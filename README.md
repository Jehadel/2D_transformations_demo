# 2D_transformations_demo
Shows 2x2 matrices use for simple 2D transformations (rotation, translation, scaling…)

See the comments in source for  detailed explanations

On line demo

2x2 matrices have a lot of limitations :

- all transformations are origin centered
- they can’t provide basic transformations like translation
- some transformations like scaling, etc. imply unwanted translations

That’s why 3x3 matrices are a better choice ! See this repository
